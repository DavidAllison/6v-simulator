## GitHub Pages

### Pros
- **Zero Cost**: Completely free for public repositories
- **Simple Setup**: Just push to gh-pages branch or configure Actions
- **Automatic SSL**: HTTPS enabled automatically
- **Integrated with GitHub**: No external accounts needed
- **Automatic Deployment**: Works out of the box
- **Good Performance**: Uses Fastly CDN
- **Maintenance-Free**: GitHub handles all infrastructure

### Cons
- **Limited Control**: Cannot configure caching, headers, or CDN behavior
- **PR Previews**: Requires third-party services (Vercel, Netlify)
- **Single Domain**: Can only use one custom domain

- **No Analytics**: Limited visibility into traffic

### Best For
- Personal projects
- Open source projects
- Documentation sites
- Projects with simple hosting needs
- Teams wanting zero infrastructure management

### Current Implementation
```yaml
# Already configured in .github/workflows/deploy.yml

- **Professional**: Industry-standard solution

### Cons
- **Cost**: ~$10-30/month for moderate traffic
- **Complexity**: Requires AWS account and configuration
- **Learning Curve**: Need to understand AWS services
- **Maintenance**: Occasional updates and monitoring needed

- **Credentials Management**: Need to secure AWS access keys

### Best For
- Production applications
- Commercial projects
- Projects needing PR previews
- High-traffic applications
- Projects requiring advanced CDN features
- Teams with DevOps experience

### Proposed Implementation
```yaml
# Configured in .github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml
- Production: 6v-simulator-prod bucket
- PR Previews: 6v-simulator-previews bucket
- CloudFront for global CDN
- Automatic cache invalidation
```

## Feature Deep Dive

### PR Preview System

**GitHub Pages**
- No native support
- Options:
  - Deploy to separate repositories (complex)
  - Use Vercel/Netlify free tier (external service)
  - Manual deployment to gh-pages subdirectories

**AWS S3 + CloudFront**
- Native support with dedicated infrastructure
- Each PR gets unique URL: `pr-123.preview.6v-simulator.com`
- Automatic cleanup when PR closed
- Complete isolation from production
- SEO protection for preview environments

### Performance Comparison

**GitHub Pages**
- Global CDN via Fastly
- ~50-100ms latency (varies by region)
- Basic caching (assets cached for 10 minutes)
- No control over cache headers
- Shared infrastructure

**AWS CloudFront**
- 400+ edge locations worldwide
- ~20-50ms latency (configurable)
- Full cache control (per file type)
- Custom cache behaviors
- Dedicated infrastructure

### Cost Analysis

**GitHub Pages**
```
Monthly Cost: $0
- Hosting: Free
- Bandwidth: Free (up to 100GB)
- Build minutes: Free (2000/month)
- SSL: Free
```

**AWS S3 + CloudFront**
```
Monthly Cost Estimate (moderate traffic):
- S3 Storage (10GB): $0.23
- S3 Requests (100k): $0.40
- CloudFront Transfer (50GB): $4.25
- CloudFront Requests (1M): $1.00
- CloudFront Invalidations: $0.50
Total: ~$6-10/month

High traffic (1TB transfer): ~$85/month
```

## Migration Path

### Staying with GitHub Pages
No action needed - already configured and working.

### Migrating to AWS

1. **Phase 1: AWS Setup** (1-2 hours)
   - Run setup script in `infrastructure/aws/`
   - Create AWS resources
   - Configure GitHub Secrets

2. **Phase 2: Parallel Running** (1 week)
   - Keep GitHub Pages active
   - Deploy to both platforms
   - Compare performance

3. **Phase 3: Full Migration**
   - Update DNS to CloudFront
   - Disable GitHub Pages workflow
   - Monitor for issues

## Recommendations

### Choose GitHub Pages If:
- [x] Project is personal/educational
- [x] Budget is zero
- [x] Don't need PR previews
- [x] Traffic is under 100GB/month
- [x] Want minimal maintenance
- [x] Simple hosting needs are sufficient

### Choose AWS S3 + CloudFront If:
- [ ] Project is commercial/professional
- [ ] Need PR preview deployments
- [ ] Require advanced CDN features
- [ ] Want detailed analytics
- [ ] Need multiple domains/subdomains
- [ ] Expect high traffic
- [ ] Want maximum performance

## Hybrid Approach

You can also use both:
1. **GitHub Pages** for the main demo site (free, simple)
2. **AWS** for PR previews only (minimal cost, ~$2-5/month)

This gives you PR previews without full migration costs.

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | GitHub Pages | AWS | Winner |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----|--------|
| Cost | 30% | 10/10 | 6/10 | GitHub Pages |
| Features | 25% | 6/10 | 10/10 | AWS |
| Performance | 20% | 7/10 | 10/10 | AWS |
| Simplicity | 15% | 10/10 | 6/10 | GitHub Pages |
| Scalability | 10% | 7/10 | 10/10 | AWS |

**For the 6v-simulator project specifically:**
- As an open-source physics simulation demo → **GitHub Pages is recommended**
- If you need PR previews → **Consider the hybrid approach**
- If this becomes a production application → **Migrate to AWS**

## Conclusion

Both options are excellent for different use cases. For the 6v-simulator project as an open-source demonstration of physics research, GitHub Pages provides an ideal balance of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and performance. The AWS infrastructure has been prepared and documented should you need to migrate in the future for additional features like PR previews or enhanced performance.

The infrastructure is ready for either choice:
- **GitHub Pages**: Already working via `deploy.yml`
- **AWS**: Ready to activate via `deploy-aws.yml`

You can even run both simultaneously during evaluation!
